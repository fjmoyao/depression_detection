"i'd never heard this idea until recently, and i'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. i strenuously disagree with this, and i feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. but that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made. thoughts?",1613,0,204,i hear idea recently i start crop opposition kind support empathy homeless attempt help homeless pointless homeless people want homeless housing program assistance mental health substance abuse support waste homeless lazy homelessness enjoy condition work pay bill responsibility lazy etc i strenuously disagree i feel like attempt goalpost grow awareness homeless people necessarily homeless get position deserve substance abuse issue mental health problem couple breakdown social network lie lefty propaganda people want believe despite legitimate reason homeless shelter moral failing go circle deserve help homelessness consequence decision thought,"i hear idea recently , i start crop , opposition kind support empathy homeless attempt help homeless pointless homeless people want homeless housing program assistance , mental health substance abuse support waste homeless lazy homelessness enjoy condition , work , pay bill , responsibility , lazy etc . i strenuously disagree , i feel like attempt goalpost grow awareness homeless people necessarily homeless get position deserve , substance abuse issue mental health problem , couple breakdown social network . lie , lefty propaganda , people want believe , despite legitimate reason homeless shelter , , moral failing go circle , deserve help homelessness consequence decision . thought ?"
